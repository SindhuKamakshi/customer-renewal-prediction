# customer-renewal-prediction
Machine learning project to predict SaaS customer renewal or cancellation

## 📌 Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major challenge for SaaS companies.  
The goal of this project is to predict whether a SaaS customer will **renew** or **cancel** their subscription using machine learning.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Predict subscription renewal or cancellation
- Help businesses take proactive retention actions
- Build an end-to-end machine learning solution

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (SaaS Churn Dataset)
- Data includes:
  - Subscription details
  - Usage behavior
  - Revenue metrics
  - Upgrade/Downgrade flags

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab ✅
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- GitHub

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model
- Logistic Regression
- Handled class imbalance using class weights
- Model predicts:
  - **RENEW**
  - **CANCEL**

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Focus on churn detection performance

---

## 🔮 Prediction Example
The model can take new customer data as input and predict:
- Renewal Probability
- Cancellation Probability
- Final Decision (Renew / Cancel)

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset ZIP file
3. Run cells step by step
4. Enter new customer data to get predictions
